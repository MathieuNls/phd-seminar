An Aggregate Bug Repository for Developers and Researchers\[chap:bumper\]
=========================================================================

In this chapter, we present <span>BUMPER</span> (BUg Metarepository for
dEvelopers and Researchers). The role of <span>BUMPER</span> is to
aggregate information belonging to the version control and project
management systems. <span>BUMPER</span> acts as our consolidated
dataset.

The materials presented in this chapter are based on the following
publications:

    Language Search of Millions Bugs and Fixes. In Proceeding of the
    International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and

JCHARMING: Java CrasH Automatic Reproduction by directed Model checkING\[chap:jcharming\]
=========================================================================================

In this chapter, we present <span>JCHARMING</span> (Java CrasH Automatic
Reproduction by directed Model checkING). <span>JCHARMING</span> is an
approach to reproduce field-crash. Every time a bug report is submitted
to a project management system and aggregated by <span>BUMPER</span>,
<span>JCHARMING</span> will try to reproduce it. In case of success, the
steps to reproduce the bug are saved in <span>BUMPER</span>.

The materials presented in this chapter are based on the following
publications:

-   Nayrolles, M. , Hamou-Lhadj, W., Tahar, S. & Larsson, A. (2016). A
    Bug Reproduction Approach Based on Directed Model Checking and
    Crash Traces. Journal of Software: Evolution and Process.
    Wiley. 2016. (Accepted).
