\chapter{An Aggregate Bug Repository for Developers and Researchers\label{chap:bumper}}

In this chapter, we present {\tt BUMPER} (BUg Metarepository for dEvelopers and Researchers).
The role of {\tt BUMPER} is to aggregate information belonging to the version control and project management systems.
{\tt BUMPER} acts as our consolidated dataset.

The materials presented in this chapter are based on the following publications:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Nayrolles, M. \& Hamou-Lhadj, W. BUMPER: A Tool to Cope with Natural Language Search of Millions Bugs and Fixes. In Proceeding of the International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER'16) - Tool Track, pages 649-652, 2016.

\chapter{JCHARMING: Java CrasH Automatic Reproduction by directed Model checkING\label{chap:jcharming}}

In this chapter, we present {\tt JCHARMING} (Java CrasH Automatic Reproduction by directed Model checkING).
{\tt JCHARMING} is an approach to reproduce field-crash.
Every time a bug report is submitted to a project management system and aggregated by {\tt BUMPER}, {\tt JCHARMING} will try to reproduce it.
In case of success, the steps to reproduce the bug are saved in {\tt BUMPER}.

The materials presented in this chapter are based on the following publications:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Nayrolles, M. , Hamou-Lhadj, W., Tahar, S. & Larsson, A. (2016). A Bug Reproduction Approach Based on Directed Model Checking and Crash Traces. Journal of Software: Evolution and Process. Wiley. 2016. (Accepted).
